# Generic-Sorting-Application

This project demonstrates a generic implementation of the selection sort algorithm in C#. It includes sorting arrays of custom Student objects as well as arrays of integers. The project highlights the use of generics to create a reusable sorting function that can handle any data type implementing the IComparable interface. This project is designed to showcase fundamental concepts of algorithms, particularly sorting techniques, and their application in handling different data types efficiently.

## Instructions:

### Sorting Students by Name and Age:

Students are automatically sorted by name using a generic selection sort.
The program displays the list of students before and after sorting.

### Sorting Integers:
A sample integer array is also sorted using the same generic sorting method.

### Example:

Input student names and ages: "Alice, 21", "Bob, 19".
The application sorts students alphabetically.

### Expected output:

"Alice, 21", "Bob, 19" (sorted by name).
